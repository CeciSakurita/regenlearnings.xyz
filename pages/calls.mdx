We had 31 atendees at the session
We had a quick presentation by Owocki about the restatement of Vision for regenlearning.xyz,  

Following Glen Weyl presented the Plurality book and shared the discord server where to join the movement (https://discord.gg/EQa2BjY8) started a 4 month tour where they are starting, and there will be opportunities for translations to different languages, just join their discord server where you can start to contribute in this matter.

Sejal Rekhan shared their RPGF training program + Pilot Cohort first experience, they produced the resourses on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial, and easeretropgf.xyz has a pool of people to support communities that want to run a QF round, if that is yuour case, fill in this form:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnNn110IDn7lgFuUxHUTKT-UN782dh5FrmjnZjpLIOn3GfBw/viewform, there is a wiki coming soon about best practices for you to have that resource at hand
EasyRetroPGF.xyz is running a QF round focused to people that has made content and brought value about RPGFs, if you were in the cohort they recommend you to apply! Link for applications: https://ezrpgf-training.vercel.app/applications

    - how to use
        1. submit a topic
        2. upvote topics
useful links shared by Sejal:   https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial

Carl shared the how was the experience for the first session on regenlearning data bootcamp, it was organized on 3 groups: pandas, foxes, cheetas, every group has calls every 3 weeks, unfortunately it got affected by Eth Denver on the timing for new update sessions wich we hope to catch up 
Here goes some docs and useful links where you can make a contribution:
    - @fcarvaeth wants to do some Gitcoin climate-round analysis using the funding data (checkout: https://github.com/opensource-observer/oss-funding)
    - @flow_science is interested in getting data flowing for NEAR projects 
    - @decentralizedceo is working on a grant proposal that includes community-led data analysis and would love some input from this group
    - @ccerv1 just released a huge bunch of docs for getting contributions to Open Source Observer (https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/contribute/). We're also getting some funding secured to reward "data challenges" — we hope to have the first data challenge posted     by this time next week!
Carl also shared the results of some data analysis already made about QF Grant Rounds, which is also open to receive any collaboration to make more analysis, add more data from other rounds and make this data set really interesting to analyse, here is the link to app:  https://ethereumgrantsdata.streamlit.app/

Then we heard pitches from 2 people due to time restriction.  Here is the list of pitches & pitch proposals 
    - [Geoweb] (https://geoweb.land/governance) for the live SQF pilot on Optimism Graven shared a new visualization tool for QF Rounds, real time metrics, they are looking to for more people to develop in this matter, check their work here:         
    https://linktr.ee/streamingqf
    - [Team TE Academy] (https://gov.optimism.io/t/ai-copilots-for-optimism-retropgf/7636) data driven informed decission tool, looking for data scientists to access the beta LLMs and build tools together, here is what team TE Academy shared:  AI Copilots for Optimism      RetroPGF CTA: Please reach out via the RegenLearnings Telegram, user name is akrtws_TE_Academy
